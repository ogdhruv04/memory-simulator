=== Cache Configuration ===

-- L1 Cache --
  Size (bytes) [default 256]:   Block size (bytes) [default 16]:   Associativity [default 4]:   Replacement policy (lru/fifo) [default lru]:   Access latency (cycles) [default 1]: 
-- L2 Cache --
  Size (bytes) [default 1024]:   Block size (bytes) [default 32]:   Associativity [default 8]:   Replacement policy (lru/fifo) [default fifo]:   Access latency (cycles) [default 10]: 
Added cache level: L1: 64 bytes, 16B blocks, 2-way, LRU (1 cycle latency)
Added cache level: L2: 256 bytes, 16B blocks, 4-way, FIFO (5 cycles latency)
Cache hierarchy initialized (Memory latency: 100 cycles)
